# Getting started with an existing Plastic SCM repository

Suppose you want to start working on a Unity project in an existing Plastic SCM repository and already have a Plastic SCM account linked to your Unity ID. In that case, you will be able to open the project straight from the **Unity Hub**! A workspace will automatically be created for your project on your machine.


1. In the Unity Hub v3 Beta, click **Open** > **Open remote project** to see the list of your Plastic SCM repositories that contain a Unity project.
   **Note**: In Unity Hub 2.4.4 and up, your Plastic SCM projects will be listed alongside Collaborate projects.
2. Click the project and click **Next**.
3. Click the Editor version and platform and click the **change version** button.
4. In the Editor pop-up, click the **Migrate** button to migrate your local workspace to a Plastic SCM workspace 
5. Once the migration is completed, click the **Open Plastic SCM** button.
