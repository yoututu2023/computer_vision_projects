# Upgrade from Collaborate to Plastic SCM

To migrate your Collab projects to Plastic SCM:

1. Create a Collab project and upload your latest changes so that your project is in sync.
2. Go to the [Collab Migration Wizard](https://www.plasticscm.com/plasticscm-cloud-edition/migrate-unity-projects/) site.
3. Complete the process to migrate every Collab project in a Unity org.
4. Wait until you receive an email from Plastic SCM that the migration process has finished.
5. Re-open the same Collab project in Unity.
6. The Migration guide will pop up, guiding you through the process of converting your local instance of your Collab project into a local instance of your Plastic workspace.
7. Once it finishes, you can continue working on your project, using the Plastic SCM window to check in your changes.
