# Export Collaborate projects 

To export your Project as a zip file that you can import into Plastic SCM:

1. Sign into the [Unity Developer Dashboard](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/).
2. At the top of the screen, click on the project name to open the dropdown list. Search for the project you'd like to export, then click on it to load its dashboard.
3. In the left navigation window, click **DevOps**. Scroll to the **Collaborate** section in the new navigation window when the new page loads, then click **Storage**.
4. Under **Exporting a Project**, click **Start Export** in the main window.
5. When the export is complete, click the **Download Export**. A zip file downloads onto your local machine.

The zip file contains all versions of all files stored in the Projectâ€™s repository, ready for import into Plastic SCM.
