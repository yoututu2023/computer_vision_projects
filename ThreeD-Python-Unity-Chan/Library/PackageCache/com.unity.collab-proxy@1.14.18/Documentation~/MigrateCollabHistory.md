# Upgrade from Collaborate without moving the history


If you're planning to lose all Collaborate history and just wish to move your project to Plastic as is, complete the following steps:

1. Open the project and disable Collaborate via the **Services** window.
2. Close Unity and make a new Plastic repository and workspace to house your project.
3. Do an initial set up on your repository (E.g. you may want to use an [ignore.conf file](ExistingPlasticRepo.md) that is specific to Unity projects).
4. Copy and paste your project into your new workspace.
5. Check in the content and continue working with the new workspace!


If you have the Version Control package installed in Unity, it is even easier!

1. Open the project and disable Collaborate via the **Services** window.
2. Open the Plastic SCM window in Unity and click on Create Workspace.
